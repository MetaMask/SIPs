title: Client-only RPC Entrypoint

## Abstract

This proposal introduces a new entrypoint, `onClientRequest`, allowing Snaps to
expose a handler that can only be called by MetaMask clients.

While request `origin` is currently used to differentiate requests from
MetaMask and dapps, this new entrypoint increases separation and minimizes the
risks associated with `origin` spoofing or request routing bugs.

## Motivation

Currently, Snaps rely on the `origin` field of incoming requests to
differentiate whether a request originates from MetaMask or an external dapp.
However, this approach has potential risks:

- **Origin Spoofing**: Bugs or vulnerabilities in request validation could
  allow dApps to masquerade as MetaMask clients.

- **Unintended Exposure**: If a Snap processes requests without strict checks,
  it may inadvertently handle dapp requests intended only for MetaMask.

- **Cleaner Separation**: Having a dedicated entrypoint for MetaMask requests
  enforces stricter request isolation at the API level.

By introducing `onClientRequest`, we ensure that Snaps can define handlers
exclusively accessible by MetaMask, reducing attack vectors and improving
request security.

## Specification

> This proposal introduces a new optional handler function, `onClientRequest`,
> which a Snap can implement.

### `onClientRequest` Entrypoint

Snaps MAY define an `onClientRequest` handler with the following signature:

```typescript
type OnClientRequest = (request: JsonRpcRequest) => Promise<JsonRpcResponse>;
```

#### Parameters

- `request: JsonRpcRequest` â€“ A JSON-RPC request object.

#### Returns

A `Promise<JsonRpcResponse>`, which resolves to a JSON-RPC response object.

#### Behavior

- MetaMask MUST ensure that the request originates from a MetaMask client
  before invoking `onClientRequest`.

- Requests from other origins MUST be rejected.

- If a Snap does not implement `onClientRequest`, the default behavior is to
  thrown an exception for any request, independent of the origin.
